Welcome to my NLP Project. In this NLP project I will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. This will be a simpler procedure, since I will utilize the pipeline methods for more complex tasks.

I will use the [Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013).

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.

I hope you will enjoy traversing through my project and appreciate it!

Thank you.
